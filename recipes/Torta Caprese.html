<p>Italian Flourless Chocolate Torte (Torta Caprese) – So Much Better Than a Box of Chocolates
    If you're looking for a deliciously decadent, yet very easy to make chocolate desert for your special someone on Valentine's Day, this is flourless, Torta Caprese, might be just the thing. Sure, it requires some measuring and mixing to put it together, but compared to what was involved in you finding that someone special to share this with, it's very, very simple.
    At first glance, this may seem similar to our chocolate decadence recipe, but that contained a little bit of flour as a binder, where as this uses almond meal instead, which I much prefer. The texture of this torte is lighter, less fudge-like, and gluten-free, in case that's how your Valentine swings. Although, we did dust the pan with flour, so you might want to adjust that by using cocoa, or a non-wheat flour.
    As I mentioned, the lightness of this will depend on gently the egg and chocolate mixtures are combined. If you just whisk everything together, you'll get something firmer and denser. If you separate the eggs, and carefully fold in the whipped whites, you'll have something that rises higher, and is much lighter. If you want to split the difference, just make it like I did. But, no matter which method you go for, I think you're going to get lots of compliments, and I really do hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces dark chocolate (70% cacao), chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 cup ground almond meal (also know as almond flour)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coffee liqueur</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>¾ cup white granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>For Serving: (optional)</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>cocoa and powdered sugar for dusting top, as needed (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh raspberries (Optional)</li>
        <li>unsweetened whipped cream for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter, and place a round piece of parchment paper in the bottom. Dust the inside and sides with flour and knock out access. Set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
    <p>Place chocolate and butter in a mixing bowl, and place on top of a saucepan filled with 1 inch of water. Place on low heat until the butter and chocolate have melted.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
    <p>Remove from heat, and stir together with a spatula. Stir in almond meal, cocoa powder, coffee liqueur, salt, and cayenne until fully combined. Set aside.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Remove from heat, and stir together with a spatula. Stir in almond meal, cocoa powder, coffee liqueur, salt, and cayenne until fully combined. Set aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Pour chocolate mixture into the egg mixture; fold in gently with a spatula until just combined. Transfer batter into the prepared pan. Tap pan on the counter to settle the mixture.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden skewer inserted near the center comes out almost clean, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
        <p>Let cool for 30 minutes in the pan before turning out onto a plate. Let cool to room temperature, before wrapping and transferring into the fridge to chill before serving.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <p>Before cutting, the top can be dusted with cocoa and/or powdered sugar if desired. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream and fresh raspberries.</p>
