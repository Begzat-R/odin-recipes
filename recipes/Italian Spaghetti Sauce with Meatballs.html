        <p>This is an Italian-style pasta sauce with homemade meatballs that's cooked slowly over low heat for an intense tomato flavor. It's easy to make the spaghetti sauce ahead of time; gently reheat and add meatballs 30 minutes before you're ready to serve with your favorite pasta.</p>

        <h1>How to Make Spaghetti Sauce With Meatballs</h1>
        <p>You'll find the full step-by-step recipe below, but here's what you can expect from this easy recipe:        </p>
        <h2>Make the Meatballs</h2>
        <p>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan, black pepper, garlic powder, and egg in a bowl. Form into meatballs. Store, covered, in the refrigerator until ready to use.

            While we love this method, some reviewers like to brown the meatballs before adding them to the sauce to lock in the flavor.
            </p>
            <h2>Make the Sauce</h2>
            <p>In a large saucepan, combine garlic, onion, tomatoes, salt, sugar, and a bay leaf. Simmer those ingredients for 90 minutes.</p>
            <h2>Add the Meatballs
            </h2>
            <p>Add tomato paste, basil, pepper, and the meatballs to the sauce. Simmer for an additional 30 minutes (or until meatballs are cooked).

<h1>Can you Freeze Spaghetti Sauce with Meatballs?</h1>
<p>Absolutely, and it's actually a great idea! You'll want to brown the meatballs first before freezing them, however.
    If you make a big batch of sauce, add a few meatballs to zip-top freezer bags and top with sauce. Label the bags and freeze them flat. Sauce will remain fresh for up to three months.
    You can also freeze the sauce and meatballs separately. Simply ladle the sauce in zip-top freezer bags and freeze them flat.
    To freeze meatballs, first brown them, then place them on a baking sheet. Freeze the baking sheet for a few hours (or overnight), until the meatballs are solid. Transfer the frozen meatballs to a zip-top freezer bag.
    Sauce and meatballs will remain fresh for up to three months.</p>
